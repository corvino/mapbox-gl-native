# AppleTV

A first run at getting MapboxGL running on AppleTV.

# Building

To build MapboxGL on a Mac you have to install a few dependencies:

* [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty); can be installed with ```sudo gem install xcpretty```.
* [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc); can be installed from homebrew with ```brew install appledoc```. Except it doesn't appear to be in homebrew at the moment, so clone, archive, and copy executable into path.

# Status

* Code disabled using preprocessor conditionals for references that don't compile on tvOS.
* Added package.sh for tvOS.
* Static libraries from Mason are still built for iOS.
* Project file for tvOS is not generated by the build system.

# Building

```
make Xcode/ios
```

Change ***BaseSDK to **tvOS 9.0** and **Supported Platforms** to **tvOS** in static library targets of ./build/ios-all/mbgl.xcodeproj. These are core, platform-ios, http-nsurl, asset-fs, and cache-sqlite.

```
make ipackage-tv
```

Find output in **./build/ios/pkg/static/**
